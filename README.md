# Confu - YAML based command-line argument parser generator

**WIP**.

Intent - create a tool that would generate a Zig specific (support more languages later?) command-line argument parser based on a YAML provided configuration.

- Core Ideas
  - `Confu` should only be a *develompent time* dependency
  - `Confu` should be able to generate a Zig file that can be included in the project
  - `Confu` generated code should be easy to use
